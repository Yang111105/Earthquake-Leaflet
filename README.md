# leaflet-challenge

This script built a new map visualization tool for the past 7 days earthquake data from USGS. It utilized both html (index.html) and Javascript (logic.js).
The data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color: Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appeared larger and earthquakes with greater depth appeared darker in color.

Popups were included to provide title and earth depth information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

A legend was provided to show the color scale for earth depth data.

### Instructions:

1. Clone repo to local folder
2. Create config.js to include map box API
3. Open index.html with Live Server
